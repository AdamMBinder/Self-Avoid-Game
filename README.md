# Self-Avoid-Game
A game utilizing Self-Avoiding Walks (SAW). Developed with Java Swing and supports 1-4 players in a game, each player takes turns placing their token on the game board. A player must make an adjacent move but cannot intersect with another piece. If a piece intersects, the player loses. In addition, if a Self-Avoiding Polygon is created (where a player manages to intersect with the starting game piece), that player wins.
